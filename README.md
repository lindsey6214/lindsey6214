## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

ðŸŽ“ Junior at Salem State University, studying Computer Science & Mathematics
ðŸ”­ Aspiring Data Scientist and Machine Learning Enthusiast

I love tackling real-world problems through data analysis and predictive modeling. Iâ€™m big on continuously learning and building my skills, and believe taking initiative is key to growth. (Ask me about growing my technical skills and leadership as a [Break Through Tech Fellow](https://www.breakthroughtech.org/)!) Currently, I'm focusing on building machine learning models and diving deeper into data science. Iâ€™m looking to leverage and grow my skills in an internship where I can contribute to exciting projects and learn from industry professionals- got any leads? Let me know!


ðŸŽ¯ Featured Project: Sentiment Analysis for American ExpressLinks to an external site.
What We Did: Preprocessed and vectorized text data using spaCy, then built an SVM classifier to predict sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral)
Tools: Python, spaCy, scikit-learn
Result: 85% accuracy, , outperforming the baseline by 20%, and provided insights that helped guide data-driven improvements in customer service.

âœ¨ Fun Fact:
A matcha latte is my favorite accessory, and you can find me with it when coding to my favorite Lo-Fi playlist, engaging in fun-yet-charged discussion on AI ethics with my Women in Tech group, or decompressing with a TikTok scroll.
