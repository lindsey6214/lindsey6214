## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

ðŸŽ“ Junior at Salem State University, studying Computer Science & Mathematics
ðŸ”­ Aspiring Data Scientist and Machine Learning Enthusiast

I love tackling real-world problems through data analysis and predictive modeling. Iâ€™m big on continuously learning and building my skills, and believe taking initiative is key to growth. (Ask me about growing my technical skills and leadership as a [Break Through Tech Fellow](https://www.breakthroughtech.org/)!) Currently, I'm focusing on building machine learning models and diving deeper into data science. Iâ€™m looking to leverage and grow my skills in an internship where I can contribute to exciting projects and learn from industry professionals- got any leads? Let me know!


ðŸŽ¯ Featured Project: Music Composition Using Deep Learning
What We Did: Our project applies deep learning to audio data, with the goal of building a model that generates music. Weâ€™ve classified audio samples and explored music data formats, studying different types of deep learning models and how to train them with musical inputs.
Tools: Python, MATLAB
Result: Audio file outputs!


ðŸ›  Tech Stack:
Languages: Python, Java, C, C++
Data Science: Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, TensorFlow
Web Dev: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (basic), Node.js
Tools: Jupyter Notebooks, Google Colab, Git, GitHub
Databases: SQL, MySQL
 

ðŸš€ Projects:
Will be updated soon...
